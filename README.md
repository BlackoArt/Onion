## Installation

#### Installation (Fresh Install):
- Format your SD card as FAT32. (Use a fast, trusted brand. The SD card sent with your Miyoo Mini is slow, and will likely ruin your experience and data.)
- Unzip the `.tmp_update` folder and its contents to the root of your SD.
- Boot up your Miyoo Mini and follow the on-screen instructions to get started.
- Your Mini will turn off once installation is complete.
 (Don't delete the .tmp_update folder, it is now part of the Onion installation.)
- Copy your Bios files into the `BIOS` folder.

#### Installation (Upgrade):
- (If coming from <= V3.09, backup your saves (retroarch / .retroarch / saves | states), you will have to copy them afterwards in the `Saves` folder of your SD)
- Delete all folders from your SD except `BIOS`, `Roms`, `Saves` and `Themes`.
- Note : Save your `Saves` folder to copy it back if you want to keep your custom emulator settings.
- Unzip the `.tmp_update` folder to the root of your SD.
- Boot up your Miyoo Mini and follow the on-screen instructions to get started.
- Your Mini will turn off once installation is complete.
 (Don't delete the `.tmp_update` folder, it is now part of the Onion installation.)

Although it's optional, we consider the launcher to be central to the Onion OS experience.  
The Onion Launcher is a user interface designed to be triggered when the Miyoo Mini starts.  
It allows you to launch the last game played in a few seconds, and, with a simple press of a button, save your progress and turn off the console.  
It also allows you to quickly change games and many other features:

- Quick boot your last game played.
- Quickly switch games from your history.
- Full overlay with accurate brightness, battery readings and playtimes.
- Improved brightness curve for better low-light gaming.
- Improved Sleep Mode with full game suspension (menu + power).
- Custom charging screen that prevents screen burn-in.
- Removed low bat flickering icon.
- Large new low battery (<10%) indicator with periodic warning rumble.
- When the battery goes below 4%, the game is automatically saved to prevent losing progress, and the handheld is turned off.

### RetroArch Rebuilt From Scratch
